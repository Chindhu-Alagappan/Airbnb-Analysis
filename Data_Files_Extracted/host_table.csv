Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

The Wonderful City of Rio has so much to offer as I have learned from my own experience, from the traditional Samba during Carnival to the less-known Parque das Ruinas in Santa Teresa (all close by the apartment).

I grew up in the midwest and have lived in NYC for about 13 years. Ive been in my current (3 bedroom) apartment for about 12 years and have been doing airbnb for about half of that time! I am in my mid 30's, I work from home and enjoy a friendly, clean, peaceful environment.

If im home, Im often working in my room/home office. From time to time i host small meetings in my room or living room. Guests are welcome to come and go as they please. Since i have 2 rooms on airbnb i just ask folks to be mindful of other people, shared bathroom and kitchen, etc.  Although i dont normally get to spend a lot of time with guests, I truly enjoy meeting new people and it means so much to me for people to enjoy my home. Given the high rate of gentrification where i live, im also happy to share more about local businesses to support that invest in families who have historically lived in this neighborhood.

1095174,"I am a first grade teacher who enjoys teaching young children. I grew up in the  the Mid-West and saw the beauty of living in California.  I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!

This beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house. The beach is a 15 minute hike from the community center in Milolii. I just enjoyed Easter services with the local people and it was wonderful at the little yellow church in the village. It really is a special place set  near  the last hawaiian fishing village

Maui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.

I used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.

I am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.

I have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.

Hi there!

I`m Rafaela, a professional actress who loves the arts.

I have a degree in Theater Theory from the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

I started receiving people through AirBnB at the 2016 Olympics and since then Edson, my co-host, and I have welcomed more than 500 guests from over 29 countries across 5 continents.

Thanks to AirBnB I discovered a new passion beyond the arts and traveling. I discovered the pleasure of learning new languages and being able to communicate with people from different cultures.

Maybe I will greeting you in your language. Who Knows?

Rio is amazing! Come see for yourself!

Seja bem vindo!
Eu adoro conhecer novas pessoas, compartilhar ensinamentos e pontos de vista. 
Amo a natureza, respirar um puro ar e me sentir conectada a energia da terra.
Me sinto muito feliz em receber convidados simpáticos que desejam experimentar ótimos momentos no Rio e desfrutar das alegrias e belezas deste lugar que eu tanto amo.
Botafogo é um bairro  onde a vida histórica e contemporânea convivem com charme a harmonia. Rodeado por montanhas e ruas arborizadas, viver em  Botafogo tem custo mais baixo que os outros bairros da zona sul, aqui é repleto de restaurantes, bares, feiras, museus e eventos culturais que acontecem com muita frequência, o bairro fica a poucos minutos do centro do Rio e dos principais pontos turísticos. A vila onde a casa está localizada foi construída há quase 100 anos, tem muitas árvores que recebem a visita de adoráveis animais da Mata Atlântica.
  A poucos minutos de caminhada  você encontrará a ""Praia de Botafogo"" que compõem uma das vistas mais incríveis do Rio, se preferir pegue o caminho oposto e dê um pulinho na Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, de lá aproveite pra curtir o por do sol no Arpoador.
  Durante muito anos o Rio de Janeiro foi a capital do Brasil, então imagine passear entre as centenárias ruas de paralelepípedos do Centro do Rio, rodeado por prédios memoráveis de  belíssima arquitetura do século 19. 
  O bairro da Urca, onde abriga o bondinho do Pão de Açúcar, está a menos de 15 minutos de ônibus ou táxi.
  O Cristo Redentor  pode ser visto da janela  e você pode chegar a subida do Morro do Corcovado em apenas 15 minutos de ônibus ou táxi.
 Será um prazer compartilhar todas as dicas e lugares especiais que conheci ao longo dos meus anos de vida nesta cidade maravilhosa.

1206363,"More about us below but First a Lava and Park Update as of 1.16.19
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has reopened on Septemb (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) However due to the Government shut down limited areas within the main Park are accessible. Still very much worth the visit.  The Kahuku Units remains open.

After three months of eruptions in lower Puna punctuated by a damaging wildfire that burned nearly 3,800 acres of forest on Mauna Loa and Hurricane Lane lashing the Island with heavy rains and strong winds at the end of August the Island of Hawaii is in recovery mode and regaining normalcy.  AND we have a new Black Sand Beach at Pohoiki which IS accessible.

The USGS and Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are reporting that sulfur dioxide emissions at Kilauea summit and in the Lower East Rift Zone in Puna, where lava flows were occurring, have fallen drastically since the start of August and are at their lowest combined level in more than a decade.

Kilauea's latest eruption began May 3 with lava flowing continuously until Aug. 6. The affected Puna area, in the southeast corner of the island comprises one percent of the island of Hawaii, which is larger than all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined.  We are in Upper Puna and were not affected by the flow.
Visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   OR  USGS Kilauea for future updates.

KAEO is an enthusiastic gardener,occasional travel agent, sometimes Hula Girl, Hawaii born, ambassador to the culture, caregiver, former Ad exec and sometimes 'pretty good cook'.  She has lived on Oahu, Maui and now the ""best""-Island of Hawaii.  I've hiked hundreds on miles on ALL the islands, in past days:  Mauna Loa, Waimanu, Polipoli, Waihee, Wailau, Hauula, the Koolaus & Wainae Mountains.  A kayak trip to Kalalau circumvented the difficult 10.8m hike.  KARL is a master tile setter and works on all phases of the Carpentry, Remodel & Building Industry.  He built Eco Hale; we estimate using at least 60% re-purposed materials.  He also built our home in Mountain View and worked with his family numerous times on the Mainland and Hawaii to build their homes.  He is a Huge sports fan (Raiders in particular).  Karl comes from a family that simply needs their toothbrush when someone announces ""Road Trip""; hence thousands of miles visiting U.S. parks, cities and sights.  Our romance began on the island of Maui and our adventure, commitment and curiosity to/for one another continues.
We love the entrepreneurial, independent alternative lifestyle and very much enjoy sharing our slice of paradise in the rain forest.  Our lives have been enriched by the many guests from around the world who enjoy privacy and nature.

12091894,"Olá, Sou o Armando Machado.

Sou carioca, apaixonado pelas cidades do Rio de Janeiro e de Florianópolis. Sou amante de viagens, e gosto de andar de moto e fazer Snowboard. 

O projeto do Jurerê Loft nasceu de muitas idas à Ilha da Magia, e decidi que precisava de um bom motivo para voltar mais vezes. Decidi investir nos apartamentos assim que os vi. O Alex me apresentou cada um dos 4, me apaixonei e pensei: Porquê não transformar esses lofts em uma experiência mágica para os hóspedes do mundo todo? Até hoje o Alex me ajuda com a gestão do Airbnb e a cada comentário elogiando o local e nosso atendimento, me sinto de fato realizado.

Tudo que temos aprendido nesse tempo de Airbnb tem nos ensinado muito, e espero sempre oferecer uma excelente experiência na estadia dos nossos hóspedes!

Estou sempre disponível para dúvidas sobre qualquer uma das cidades, dicas e sugestões (Sempre bem vindas).

Um Grande Abraço!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. 

Our corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. 

And I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. 

At KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. 

Another activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture.

Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. 

Hong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia.

13433868,"Four friends, a lot of dreams, a common path

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

I am so blessed to offer people from all around the world the chance to experience the breath taking scenery and beautiful culture of an island paradise I have called home for my entire life. My family has been in the vacation rental business for over 30 years and it all started with my grandmother Kay (hence Kay's Ali'i Vacation Rental). Now myself, my mother Brenda, my wife Kristina, and my aunt Lucy have taken over the reins and are continuing the legacy my grandmother started. 

Our families journey in the vacation rental industry started with one small simple unit and slowly evolved into something special for generations to come. We now we have 3 vacation rental properties in Kailua with multiple units on each. Our goal is to offer parties of all sizes the chance to visit our island paradise without having to break their bank accounts. We have 2, 3, & 4 bedroom units for larger groups or extended family getaways.

14298859,"I am the owner of Maui Vision Rental. Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.

Maui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.

I used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.

I am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.

I have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

Booking tip: I encourage you to book asap if the days in calendar are open or as soon as I reply to you. I don't know how the guest part system works. But I've had people who send inquiries to whom I've sent pre-approved responses. This doesn't mean anything until you actually book (make the payment). During this time I can still pre-approve other people and even other guests can go ahead of you and our previous conversations and book! They will actually get the booking. Sorry in advance for any inconveniences, but at least I am giving you heads up.

However, I keep busy managing both properties, when we're not dancing, playing softball/tennis, or at the beach.  One of the advantages of living here on Kauai and offering vacation properties for rent is that any issues with units that may arise are addressed immediately and decisively through direct communication between the guests and me, the owner. There is no go-between management company in the loop to delay any action that may be required.  It's a win-win for everyone.

As host:
I hosted over 80 people in 2 years of Airbnb and we earned Super Hosts status 2 years in a row! 
My husband Claudio is Italian and I'm Brazilian. We work from home and we are very fast replying guest messages when we are not here to answer in person.

Also, we are 15 minutes walking distance to Coogee Beach (our favourite!).

The thought was if we fail, no harm done! I feel blessed every day to call Hawaii home. Although I do miss my family on the mainland, I (we) have our other half with us here, Mother and Father in law moved here 12+ yrs  and my Brother and sister in law just 2+ years ago! Being able to get together every Sunday to cook and enjoy each other is something I don’t take for granted.  Love the ocean, with my favorite past time now which is stand up paddle boarding. I was a Dental Assistant for a total of 18 yrs, then quit to help my husband run his construction company. Never did I think I would be doing a bnb, (always have done long term) but oh how I enjoy it!! Love people and enjoy them seeing the islands for their first time or coming back for more to do something they missed or needs repeating...never can one see it all. I hope you will come and enjoy our little slice of Hawaii here on the west side of the island.

16651655,"Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.
I like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...

During my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.
A well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.

As you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.

My home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)

My place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.
If you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.
Our fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.
The vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.

In any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.

I can offer you 1 bedroom flat or studios in the center of the istanbul,at the location Taksim square meets. For surroundings please give me couple of minutes by reading below.

History of the Location of the apartment: 

The main thoroughfare is İstiklâl Caddesi, running into the neighbourhood from Taksim Square, a pedestrianised 300meter of shops, cafés, patisseries, restaurants, pubs, wine houses and clubs, as well as bookshops, theatres, cinemas and art galleries. Some of İstiklâl has a 19th century metropolitan character, and the avenue is lined with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau buildings.[citation needed] The nostalgic tram which runs on İstiklal Avenue, between Taksim Square and Tünel, was also re-installed in the early 1990s with the aim of reviving the historic atmosphere of the district. 
Some of the city's historic pubs and winehouses are located in the areas around İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu. The 19th century Çiçek Pasajı (literally Flower Passage in Turkish, or Cité de Péra in French, opened in 1876) on İstiklal Avenue can be described as a miniature version of the famous Galleria in Milan, Italy, and has rows of historic pubs, winehouses and restaurants",1,5025972,0,0,3,"Istanbul, Turkey",Rahman,Taksim,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5025972/profile_pic/1416934198/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,0.0,not mentioned,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5025972/profile_pic/1416934198/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,3,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5025972,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews']"

I love meeting new people and traveling! I came to this beautiful island over ten years ago on vacation. I quickly fell in love with the island and decided to not fly back! The people and culture here are unlike any other. I love it, especially here in Waikiki. There is always something new going on, which is why I love living here. I started bartending and quickly got to know a lot of the insurance and outs of Oahu. My career has brought me so much joy, and introduced me to some of the best people on Earth. It  has blessed me so much, and  I am very thankful to be here making an impact on people's lives. Now I am Food and Beverage Manager for a 5 star Resort.

For fun besides traveling, I enjoy practicing Capoeira (Brazilian martial art) , dancing, working out, speaking Japanese, reading, showing people a good time, relaxing on the beach, and of course hiking!

As a host I will provide you with all the info to have a great time in beautiful Waikiki. I'll make sure you enjoy your stay.

Thank you for checking my home; My name is Mike, and I've been living in Hawaii for 28 years. 

A little bit about myself: I have a degree in Architecture, and own a construction company. I love building and seeing the smile on people's faces when they see the home of their dreams, it puts a smile in my heart. 

The same happiness I get from building, I get from hosting; I love to meet people from all walks of life learn about their cultures, and see the smile on their face when they arrive in my home.

In my free time I enjoy spending it with my family and friends, having a nice glass of good wine with my loved ones, and taking my dogs out for a swim at the beach on a beautiful sunny day.

Enjoy life to the max when you can.

17155854,"ALOHA and WELCOME to Waikiki, Honolulu on Oahu!  Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

1719942,"My main hobby is searching; I search about everything related to life-style, design, arquitecture, decoration, fashion, restaurants, shops, cool places in general and, I confess, gossip!
Poker was a mix of hobby and profession, it came to me by fun, playing online but, started to met people in the real world, and
writing for magazines and websites. During 8 years I had an weekly column in J magazine, what ended with an invitation to cooperate with BetClick for the Poker section in their Portuguese branch office. 
To handle my Poker consulting business, I founded ""Coisas do Poker"" (""Things about Poker). 
But, my real passion is interior design and receive people.
Until now, I only practiced in in-house projects, for personal needs, in the different appartments where I lived.
For eight years, I lived in Luxembourg, where I worked in the headquarters of the European Community Parliament, revising texts for the Portuguese publications.
After a short return to Portugal, I went to Brazil for one year, this time, just for fun, where I lived in Araras and Rio de Janeiro.
Now I've embraced, somehow, professional projects in these areas, like this WBwGG"" (White Basement with Green Garden"", the ""Caramba!"" and the ""WHwTG"" (White House with Tasca Gourmet).
The ""Caramba!"" is an, already running, project with my friend Marina where we convert old fashioned furniture, and objects, into cool stuff.
Most of my parent's furniture will be the guinea pig and, once transformed, will be exposed in hot spots in the city but, also, in the house, where guests can see and even use.
The ""WHwTG"" is on his half way to launch, it's also a guest house but in the countryside, in Póvoa da Raínha, a very small place on the way to Serra da Estrela.
This is my grandparent's house, a typical old stone house of the Portuguese countryside, which I've adapted to be comfortable but keeping the original trace.
The purpose here is, not only, receive guests but, also, open the ""tasca gourmet"" to serve, and sell, regional food and beverage and promote tasting events.
With luck, the project in Póvoa da Raínha can be extended for the family lands that will face the water mirror of the future Girabolhos dam, under construction and, expected to be finished in one, or two years.

Here is a little of myself, what I've been doing and future projects but, here, may main goal is to have the chance to receive, the best possible, everyone who decides to visit us; that will be an enormous pleasure!

180653,"Hello! I'm Yara, a born and raised New Yorker from Brooklyn.  After studying and working in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles, I moved back to further my dance studies (I'm an Argentine Tango performer). I'm pretty free spirited and try to enjoy all the perks of living in Inwood! I love to hike difficult trails and like buying clothes to hike in -- although I might like buying the clothes more than hiking sometimes!   : )

I'm a huge fan of Inwood Park. It's not like Central Park at all (not that CP is bad but Inwood Park wasn't man-made). There are fewer people and it's a great place to be alone and think.  You can go to the weekly farmers market which is across the street every Saturday morning and then go on a morning hike, play tennis, basketball or soccer before finally laying out to work on your tan. Later you can watch the sunset over the Hudson River or perhaps go on a sunset hike. It really is nice up here! Come see what I see!! 

I also co-run THRIFTAHOLICS com & NYC GRINDHOUSE com with my boyfriend Michael. If you like thrifting, or want to do things in NYC cheaply, or even for FREE when you get here, you should definitely check out our site. We can get you very cheap tickets to Broadway shows!

Pre-baby we travelled a lot and our favorite destinations so far are Amsterdam and Thaliand. 

Our travel experiences enriched our lives and enhaced our firm belief in sharing, nurturing and respect for human relationships and Nature. 

We believe that people are people, and they have more or less same issues or life questions and strive for happiness no matter what their socioeconomic, religious or cultural background is. After all, we are all made of the same material - Star dust, all other differences are just shades on the canvas called life.

18611535,"Hi there,

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

Being a traveler for past few years, I was a fans of home-stay style. Very glad to share with you my properties in Hong Kong!

I am doing short term rental online and offline. Sometimes, the calendar is not very accurate because of too many sources for bookings. Just tell me what you want, we will  have many options for you!

My teams are doing great for check-in arrangement. No worry if you don't know well about Hong Kong!

Thanks

Hi,大家好我是Visnon. 

我们喜欢旅行,爱住当地的老房子,逛当地的市场,喜欢色彩浓郁的国度,探索奇葩的民风! 

我们改造了一些老房子,并加入了有趣的想法｡ 
在分享前我们都会试住几天,确保一切安好,并在细节上做更人性化的调整｡ 

因为是老房子,它有温度又有些局限,希望能体谅它｡Visnon坚持选用五星酒店出身的专业管理团队来打理房间,使用星级酒店的床品,希望我的每个客人都能感受到放心和舒适｡ 

快来香港找我们玩吧! 
Visnon会在能力范围内Do my best for you! 
愿大家都有一个美好的假期回忆~

20154076,"Hi,
I'm Sarah, french girl living in Montreal since 3 years!
I'm a graphic designer working in an Architecture agency.
For sure I love travelling and have the time of my life each time I discover new things, new cultures, new people... 
What I love the most in traveling is to get lost, and appropriate the place. My ultimate dream is to live on a boat, dive and observe fish all day long. 
I'm also crazy about local gastronomy, I love discover a country/city by eating all kind of food that I see. 

Most of the time I travel with my boyfriend Pierre-Luc, he is a designer, he creates all kind of things,with metal & wood furniture, he is so brillant. 
Our latest crazy move was to restore an old loft in one of the best Montreal's district. We created all the furniture by ourselves.
Thanks for reading me!

20280610,"I was born and raised in Switzerland, into a family of watchmakers, engineers, doctors, architects, artists, musicians, and missionaries. Uncles, aunts and cousins doing God's work all over the world, people not principally interested in money. Not to say that I do not approve of wealth and power. My grandfather, after all, was a wealthy man, founding a watch company more than 100 years ago, but let your good fortune be applied for a good purpose. 

Religion, however, is too confusing for me to understand, so I stick to nature. This is my guide in life. And it has worked very well for me so far. For these reasons, science, culture, politics. social justice, economics and all the things that make this world go round are of great interest to me. I'm green politically, blue in many ways, my eyes, my jeans, my bathroom towels, my mood once in a while, blue is good, I feel fine. Red and black attracts me, but generally, I will try to keep a cool head. White is beautiful, but what or who is spotless? Yellow and orange are great, who does not like sunshine? But I prefer gold. And silver would be my blue. It suites me better. I'll tell you more at a later point. 

Blond originally, but most hair that remains on my body is in all other places than on my head. I shave off the rest, with some stubble remaining once in a while when I'm just too lazy. I am a mountain person, strong, agile, in good shape. Style? Always appropriate for the occasion. Quality is what matters. And who does not recognize that, oh well, simply does not recognize it.

2041957,"We are avid travelors and enjoy staying at vacation rentals, like the one we have created here. We enjoy the experience because staying at a vacation rental gives one a sense of the character of the city and people you are visiting -- something you don't get from the ""sterility"" of the hotel stay.  In that light, we are proud to be able to offer our guests an opportunity to stay in an apartment that is typical of the sort built after the war to accomodate the returning service men and their families.  The neighborhood is very much residential and varied in population age wise and linguistically.  It is only a block away from a major commerical artery and very close to the metro system.

 About myself, I am a biologist who now works in education at a College in downtown montreal.  While I am very much anchored in the scientific mind set, my reading pleasure invariably centers around history -- mostly western civilization -- and art.   We enjoy living in Montreal because of its cultural richness, and benefit from all the opportunites ranging from theatre productions to museum exhibits, etc.  We also enjoy hiking through the Laurentians and the richness of the environment that surrounds Montreal, which is not that far away.

Whether you come to stay here or not, I think you will enjoy visiting this unique city in the North America.  Montreal is sure to satisfy you at many levels, and we wish you a pleasant stay.

21939239,I bought the building in 1996 in a very run down state. It was originally a grand Victorian Terrace and had been divided into 5 flats with shared bathrooms.  I embarked on a full renovation with my builder and later employer Michael Wagstaffe which included building another level on top where I now live. I decided to trial Airbnb in mid 2017 in the smallest apartment which has been very successful. In December 2017 apartment 5 became vacant so I upgraded  it for Airbnb to be ready for NYE. I   have installed double glazing and acoustic flooring to make my guests stay as comfortable as possible.  My building is in  vibrant Surry Hills so you can step out the door and find restaurants and bars a plenty than come back to peace and quiet. I try to give the best service possible to my guests.,1,115444556,1,1,3,"Surry Hills, New South Wales, Australia",Don,Surry Hills,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57183508-a16b-46c8-ade9-a07173e750e8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,100.0,within an hour,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57183508-a16b-46c8-ade9-a07173e750e8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,3,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/115444556,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']"

I am so blessed to offer people from all around the world the chance to experience the breath taking scenery and beautiful culture of an island paradise I have called home for my entire life. My family has been in the vacation rental business for over 30 years and it all started with my grandmother Kay (hence Kay's Ali'i Vacation Rental). Now myself, my mother Brenda, my wife Kristina, and my aunt Lucy have taken over the reins and are continuing the legacy my grandmother started. 

Our families journey in the vacation rental industry started with one small simple unit and slowly evolved into something special for generations to come. We now we have 3 vacation rental properties in Kailua with multiple units on each. Our goal is to offer parties of all sizes the chance to visit our island paradise without having to break their bank accounts. We have 2, 3, & 4 bedroom units for larger groups or extended family getaways. We have 1 bedroom units & large studios for our guests who are traveling with their immediate family and we also have a private rooms for those of our guests who want to get away by themselves or with their significant other to relax and enjoy our beautiful Hawaiian weather. No matter what group size you have we can accommodate you. Take a look at our listing and feel free to message us.

22586401,"ALOHA and WELCOME to Waikiki, Honolulu on Oahu!  Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

22811503,"Four friends, a lot of dreams, a common path

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Hello all the way from İstanbul, Turkey.
I welcome anybody who wishes to enjoy the comfort of staying at a nice apartment just in the very center of İstanbul at Swiss Suits. As a traveller myself,I have also had the chance of experiencing different types of cultures and am very familiar with it. During my trips around the world somehow Ifound my self running Swiss suits after completing  my degree in physical training. i believe everybody would agree with me that what feels great is to pay less for housing but enjoying the city you travel by spending more on other things rather than paying high cost hotel fees. Being aware of this, I want my guest feel the same and enjoy being İstanbul as much as they can.
ı guarantee a nice and clean accommodation, low cost recommendation, anything about the city and Turkish hospitality.
We would be pleased to welcome you here. Swiss Suites is located in the Taksim area and is literally 3 steps away from the Istiklal Street.

I am Maria, an active, travel-lover, sociable, friendly, gentle, open-minded and fun young woman originally from Valencia but who lives also some months in Barcelona. I love to travel and discover the rest of the planet… See other countries, find out about their culture and most of all their people.

 I am also a huge fan of photography, cinema, books, nature, decoration, Yoga, fitness, swimming and music.

I have a bachelor in law and currently have a managerial position in an important Spanish company related with turistic apartments.

I would like to rent out my flats and flats of other owners because I would like to think that people can visit Barcelona or Valencia and enjoy them through my apartments. As a fellow traveller I am proud to be part of this whole concept which provides and exciting alternative to standard mainstream travelling.
I would like to offer my flats preferably to families or couples wishing to know Barcelona or Valencia and its surroundings, its architecture, monuments, cuisine, their people and their habits. 
 
If you feel my places meets your requirements please do not hesitate to ask all the information you might need. Looking forward to hearing from you.





Hola a todos. 

Mi nombre es Maria, soy una persona activa, viajera, inquieta, sociable, amable, divertida y risueña. Me encanta conocer el mundo, otros países, su cultura, sus costumbres y sobretodo sus habitantes. 

Mis hobbies son, además de los viajes, la fotografía, el cine, la lectura, la naturaleza, la decoración, el yoga,  la natación, el fitness y la música.

Soy licenciada en derecho y me dedico a gestionar mis apartamentos turisticos asi como los de otros propietarios que necesitan mi ayuda.

Mis motivos para alquilar mis pisos son, aparte del económico, el poder compartirlos con otras personas para que ellas puedan disfrutarlos, el formar parte de una comunidad viajera que busca formas alternativas de viajar y poder conocer gente de otros países así como sus costumbres.
Preferiblemente deseo alojar a una familia o una pareja que deseen conocer  Barcelona o Valencia o sus alrededores, sus paisajes, sus monumentos, sus costumbres, su cocina, su gente etc..

We are Carl and Edna.  We have been coming to stay here at this property for almost 15 years, and then our adult children persuaded us to finally buy. We were very fortunate to find out that the unit we had been renting for many years came up for sale. So, of course  we bought and put our stamp on the unit that was already  filled with many happy Hawaiian memories for us both.

Carl and I come here from December through to end of March every year.  We meet the other winter-returning unit owners  (snowbirds) and thoroughly enjoy the winter Hawaiian Family that keeps us coming back year after year!

Returning to Hawaii is our focus dream every year. We want our kids to enjoy it as we enjoy it, and therefore you too.  Hawaii is calling - answer the call:)

Thank you for choosing our little piece of Paradise - we wish you as many happy Hawaiian Memories as we have created over the years!!

24322969,"I am a 26 year old student at McGill University. After several experiences with AirBnB, i realized that not only is this the new way to travel, but it is also an excellent opportunity to network with different people from all over the world! I love travelling, and the prospect of meeting new people from around the world makes AirBnB an awesome experience for myself and my roommates.

One of my best trips so far was a roadtrip across the United States. I have made this trip twice and it's amazing to see how peoples' lives vary across the country. We met many travellers along the way through AirBnB, which really inspired me to set up something similar in my own home.

Most recently, I travelled to the United Kingdom as an exchange student and during the weekends, I backpacked around Europe. My experience here was completely different from my previous travels in the United States and in Asia. It really provided me a different view of the world, not simply the North American view, and this has allowed me to communicate better with people who don't speak fluent English. Most importantly, there is an instant bond/connection that is made when I meet someone who is either from a city I have travelled to, or has been there as well!

2464745,"Olá, 
Comecei a hospedar profissionalmente a pouco tempo, mas tenho certa experiencia, pois hospedei em minha casa, muitos amigos e familiares ao longo dos 20 anos que resido no Rio de Janeiro.
Sou gaúcha, nasci do RS e mudei para a cidade maravilhosa a 20 anos. Amo minha terra, meu sul, mas me apaixonei perdidamente pelo RJ. Cheguei aqui muito novinha, decidi ficar, trabalhei bastante para isso e consegui! lembro me que assim que cheguei, por mais que eu trabalhasse e não tivesse muito tempo para diversõe, estava sempre com a impressão de que estava de férias, acredito que pela proximidade do mar e pela descontração dos cariocas.
Estudei, me formei aqui ( Direito), e toda a minha vida construi nesta cidade. Sempre gostei de hospedar e hoje, fazendo isso profissionalmente posso dizer que é sempre um prazer, adoro idéias e culturas diferentes. Tambem sou uma viajante, sempre que posso tento conhecer novos lugares, minha última viagem  foi a Turquia, uma viagem inteiramente inusitada, mas que adorei. Por esse motivo tento me colocar no lugar do hospede, procuro dar boas dicas de diversão e locais interessantes na cidade maravilhosa.
E por falar em cidade maravilhosa, essa realmente é uma cidade maravilhosa, temos belezas naturais, gente bonita, temos a descontração e a simpatia do povo carioca e adoramos receber turistas que, normalmente se encantam e retornam diversas vezes ao RJ.
Bom, tento ser pontual ( não esquecendo que estamos no RJ e as vezes o transito nos castiga bastante), cumpro com o prometido, sou uma pessoa correta, prezo a palavra  e gosto que sejam assim comigo tambem.
Essa sou eu, um pouquinho de mim!

I am a dancer and choreographer based in Paris and working abroad very often. 
I guess that I am living at other people's homes more often than I spend time in my own house because of the touring schedule. Sometimes I spend time in such lovely places that it makes me feel good and help me to focus on work. I take pictures to get inspired for my own living space... I would like to share this experience and make you feel home in a charming city where accommodation is always a big problem.

I'm from Barcelona; as were my  parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, as far back as I remember! I am a lover of my city, but of the original city of Barcelona, the whole gothic and Eixample area is spectacular!

I worked previously in communication and creativity, but for some time now I decided to use all my creativity in creating furniture and decoration. Restore anything that people do not want as they think it is useless or old or broken, I look for new uses for them so that they don’t die and remain among us.

I am delighted and 100% available to give directions and suggestions about my city! Here I´ll give you the first, advice... watch your bag! Catalans are very good people, but we also have one or two thieves…well, many actually !
 
I hope you ll feel at home in my apartment and enjoy very much the city!

See you soon!!

Estou no Airbnb desde (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) e foi quando comecei alugando um quartinho na minha casa, onde pude receber pessoas de todos os cantos do mundo e compartilhar com eles a minha paixão pelo Rio. 

O sucesso foi tão grande que passado o tempo, meus amigos e amigos de amigos, passaram a me pedir para que administrasse os seus apartamentos. Topei o desafio, e os apartamentos foram se multiplicando... larguei a Faculdade de Geografia e decidi empreender, me dedicando exclusivamente aos meus hóspedes ! Foi a melhor decisão que tomei na vida. 

Depois de alguns anos fundei a minha própria agência, a Omar do Rio, especializada em Aluguel de Temporada e hoje administro inúmeros apartamentos de temporada na cidade. Me auto realizei por poder trabalhar com uma atividade que tanto amo, que tanto agregou a minha vida. 

Meu objetivo hoje, com a minha agência, é proporcionar uma estadia segura, tranquila e de qualidade, para que meus hóspedes possam desfrutar ao máximo a experiência na Cidade Maravilhosa. 

Contem comigo e minha Equipe para obter todo o suporte e as melhores dicas que você pode ter na cidade. 

Nos vemos no Rio !

Hey,

I have been on Airbnb since (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , when I started renting a small room in my house, where I was able to receive people from all around the world and share with them my passion for Rio.

The success was so great that after time, my friends and friends of friends, 
 came to ask me to manage their listings. I accept the challenge, and the number of apartments was multiplying ... I left the University of Geography and decided to dedicate myself exclusively to my guests ! It was the best decision I ever made.

After some years I founded my own agency, Omar do Rio (Omar from Rio), specialized in Vacation Rentals and today I manage innumerable seasonal apartments in the city. I realized myself by being able to work with an activity that I love so much, that added so much to my life.

My goal today, with my agency, is to provide a safe, quiet and quality stay, so that my guests can enjoy the experience in the Marvelous City.

Count on me and my Team to get all the support and best tips you can have in town.

See you in Rio!

Omar

25780094,"Olá,

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

I've been living and working part of each year in Australia, part in Tokyo, and little working trips all over the place.

I write a Magazine column in Japanese, 'Cecilia's Permacutlure Slow Life'. Its about creative ways to de-trap your life of wasted time, energy and affection, freeing you up to do the good work you were put on this world to do. 

For more than 10 years I've run a share-house for creative people - you can read about it on my blog Balcony Garden Dreaming.

My hobbies are Japanese tea ceremony, creative dinner gatherings and drawing illustrations of the quirky world I dream to live in, and often actually do.  

I've been a WWOOF host for many years, hosting travellers who volunteer their talents to help look after this house, garden and all its creatures.  

I don't have a life motto exactly, but when thing go wrong, I ask myself 'Whiner or Designer?'.  That gets me positive and resourceful.  If things go wrong for you I won't say it though. I'll just help where I can xx

27805512,"Hello, I'm Rui Lé Costa.
I have created this project with the aim of showing Oporto to the world.
In its multiplicity of angles, this experienced and intimate city vibrates in secret places, landscapes, stories and events. Who lives there or passes by, feel it deeply.
Then, FEELPORTO passes through the common interest of the larger community of those who inhabit the city, also in the heart.
And because Oporto is part of the heart of the north of this country, its community expands through and beyond its borders. Therefore, this project is open to all interested in approaching this sense, promoting their ideas and interests on a regular basis.
This way, it can provide all visitors experiences and emotions parallel to the usual and special itineraries. I propose, therefore, that are also the unconditional city lovers, from north to south of Portugal and beyond, to be a part of this community FEELPORTO ... Because Port is Beautiful.

Aloha!  We are Brendan and family, and we enjoy sharing our beautiful three story home, 'Ohana Nui, with respectful travelers from around the world.   Brendan, single father of 2, is retired from construction (early) to be a full time dad, world traveler, and Airbnb Host.  He loves to ""talk story"" and Stand Up Paddle Surf.  The kids, though not here all the time, are two well-behaved, respectful children (ages 11 and 12) who love meeting all the ""Uncles and Aunties"" in the house.

Our newest addition to the team, Colin, is a career driven full time student, and now co-host that takes care of many of the day to day aspects of Ohana Nui and Ohana Nui Motors in Brendan's absence.  What more can we say about him, Colin is Awesome!

We keep our home smoke-free and drug-free.  We also keep everything clean and tidy.  We do not have a party house by any means, just a nice place to relax and make new friends.  

The name of our home, 'Ohana Nui, means Big Family, which is what we aspire to be to our guests.  Our family is as rich and diverse as the colors of our flag and we show aloha to all.  We strive to provide everyone with all the comforts of home; with safety, quality, and affordability; and to provide every guest with a great local feeling and local experience, all the while, just outside of Waikiki.

We count our sea-change to Hawaii as one of the best things we ever did and we absolutely love this place!  Surrounded by wild beauty, turquoise waters, bright sunshine, friendly towns, pristine beaches, epic sunsets, gleaming waterfalls, warm water, lush mountain ranges, and the sound of tropical breezes rustling through the palm trees, how could we not?
Matt and I have been married for almost 13 years and have two sons:  Ryker, who is at the very fun, adventurous age of 4, and Finn who is at the loveable age of 2.5. We also have high hopes to add more kiddos sometime in the future.  
A little about us:  we LOVE Hawaii.  The beach is our favorite playground; building sandcastles with the boys, surfing, cruising on our SUP boards, joy-riding waves to shore, exploring the underwater world with mask and snorkel, kayaking, hiking- we just can’t get enough.

I live and work in downtown Montreal. People usually describe me as a smily and a very friendly guy.

I traveled in nearly 50 countries around the globe and far from stopping there. There is so much to discover and to learn. 

What I like from travelling is the feeling of excitement to discover a new place, trying to communicate in a new language, meeting new people, trying new exotic food and learn from the others. It's great to break the routine and leave it's comfort zone.

Now that so many great Airbnb  hosts opened their doors to me, I feel it is my turn to open the door of my condo in downtown Montreal to other travellers.

I have created this project with the aim of showing Oporto to the world.
In its multiplicity of angles, this experienced and intimate city vibrates in secret places, landscapes, stories and events. Who lives there or passes by, feel it deeply.
Then, FEELPORTO passes through the common interest of the larger community of those who inhabit the city, also in the heart.
And because Oporto is part of the heart of the north of this country, its community expands through and beyond its borders. Therefore, this project is open to all interested in approaching this sense, promoting their ideas and interests on a regular basis.
This way, it can provide all visitors experiences and emotions parallel to the usual and special itineraries. I propose, therefore, that are also the unconditional city lovers, from north to south of Portugal and beyond, to be a part of this community FEELPORTO ... Because Port is Beautiful.

3040870,"I live between Rio de Janeiro and the San Francisco bay area in California.  I am a public radio DJ with a Brazilian music radio program for the last 30 years.  I am also a story teller and have a knack for making people laugh. 

I love the outdoors and especially cycling up to the Christ statue or in the hills above Silicon Valley.  I am very familiar with the musical scene of Rio and can be your guide or give you the information you need.

I am a native English speaker and speak fluent Portuguese and passable Japanese.  I also can make myself understood in Spanish.

My philosophy as a host:  My parents were very successful small business owners with a carnation farm and later a flower shop. They had their business listed in the best of Silicon Valley and even had local TV coverage.  Out of hundreds of similar businesses, they were able to differentiate themselves on how they treated and interacted with their customers.  They worked hard to give that little extra that made people want to come back.  My goal as a host is to treat as you my parents would have.  Let me show my definition of hospitality.  

Moro entre o Rio de Janeiro e nos suburbos de San Francisco, em Califórnia. Sou um DJ de rádio educativo com um programa de Música Brasileira para os últimos 30 anos. 

Eu gosto de pedalar na floresta da Tijuca subindo para o Corcovado ou nas colinas de Silicon Valley em California. Conheço bem a cena musical do Rio e possa o seu guia ou dar-lhe as informações sobre o que você deveria fazer na Cidade Maravilhosa.

Eu falo inglês e português fluentemente. Eu também entendo bastante espanhol e japônes para comunicar.

Minha filosofia como anfitrião: meus pais eram proprietários de pequena empresa muito bem sucedido com um sítio de floricultura e depois uma loja de flores. Eles tinham seus negócios listados no melhor de ""Silicon Valley"" e até tinham cobertura de TV local. Das centenas de empresas similares, eles conseguiram se diferenciar com o atendimento único aos seus clientes. Eles trabalharam um pouco mais para fazer os clientes sempre voltar. Meu objetivo como anfitrião é tratar como você teria os meus pais.

Hi,大家好我是Visnon. 

我们喜欢旅行,爱住当地的老房子,逛当地的市场,喜欢色彩浓郁的国度,探索奇葩的民风! 

我们改造了一些老房子,并加入了有趣的想法｡ 
在分享前我们都会试住几天,确保一切安好,并在细节上做更人性化的调整｡ 

因为是老房子,它有温度又有些局限,希望能体谅它｡Visnon坚持选用五星酒店出身的专业管理团队来打理房间,使用星级酒店的床品,希望我的每个客人都能感受到放心和舒适｡ 

快来香港找我们玩吧! 
Visnon会在能力范围内Do my best for you!

31465474,"I've been a camper from the age of 6! I used to go camping with my parents on a scooter. Every summer, me and my family used to go travelling through Europe on a caravan. Recently I upgraded to a campervan as it is a more sustainable option and is easier to drive and park. I love the freedom it provides for a touring holiday or escaping into Nature and my mission is to share this experience with fellow travellers. 

Our campervans provide freedom on wheels. So guests can travel with no restrictions and no ties. With no need to book hotels, no arrival schedules to limit you, no pre-paid programs to follow. It is about total freedom of choice and use to explore or relax.

You can get closer to Nature. Fall asleep under the starry sky, wake up in the middle of the mountains, have breakfast by the sea. The perfect companion for outdoor activities surrounded by Nature. Pick up your gear and go explore!

We are locals with a passion for travel and gastronomy keen on giving advice and proud of their travel library! We can suggest travel itineraries. We are specially keen on the North of Portugal region as its varied landscapes, heritage and people make it a fabulous destination that all travellers love!

Looking forward to providing you with the adventure of a lifetime!

314982,"I have been home-sharing for about 10 years now and have met many interesting people. I view visitors more as short-term roommates than I do as guests.

Home-sharing truly has been a blessing for me. It's helped me to pay the rent and still given me the flexibility to have the place all to my own when I'd like to do so. That's a huge benefit!

As a guest, I have used Airbnb to travel to Tokyo and spent a few weekends staying at a farmhouse outside New York City. We watched films on the side of a barnhouse. Very cool!

I am a relatively easy-going guy. I drink socially and do not smoke or use drugs. I definitely like to have fun, especially if it involves doing something new and it doesn't cost a ton of money. I love deals!

While I tend to be easy-going, I do have my pet-peeves. For example, a shoes-free home means just that. With that said, I ask that you please review the house ""rules"" before you book with me.

Either as a host or a guest, I'd be up for hanging out some time. I like to meet new people and explore the city together. If you'd like to hang out during your visit, then let me know in advance. My work schedule is pretty unpredictable and I often do work from home. I can get pretty busy, but if you give me some advance notice I'll make sure we have time to spend together. Otherwise, I generally assume that guests want independence.

If you prefer to do your own thing, then that's totally fine too. Don't worry I won't be offended. I can certainly appreciate that you may have a pretty full itinerary when you come to NYC.

I'm a former journalist, PR guy and worked for a non-profit in the sustainable agriculture / environmental field for many years. I started my own coaching/consulting business a few years ago and would be interested to find out more about what's going on in your life. Perhaps I can help you out in some way?

My guests have included a combination of tourists and business travelers. Whichever category you fall under, you're welcome to stay with me. I have an extra room and I'd be happy to provide you with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a New York City resident for a while. Who knows? Maybe you'll like the East Village so much that you'll want to find your own apartment and never want to leave.

I host singles and couples, but you should note that there is an added fee of $30 per night for all additional guests over one person.

The most common things I hear from guests are:

""The room is so much bigger than I thought based on the photos in your listing,""

""This is a really cool room/place!""

""I love the natural light that comes into this room!""

""It's such a comfy atmosphere in here that I really hate to leave!""

Guests really love the location! location! location!

On the flip side, I sometimes hear people remark that walking up five flights is ""telling them that they need to get into better shape.""

If nothing else, I hope that you'll find your visit with me to be enlightening (that's a joke because the bedroom is well-lit and I am a life coach ;)

Sean bienvenidos amigos. Soy carioca de la gema. Nací, crecí y viví toda mi vida en Río de Janeiro. Me encanta esta ciudad. Ya estoy aquí en este sitio como anfitrión desde hace muchos años. Durante ese tiempo, conocí a muchas personas y culturas diferentes. Ya alquilé ese apartamento para pequeños o grandes grupos que vienen a pasear o trabajar aquí, y por lo que pude constatar a todos les gusta mucho del lugar por las facilidades que encuentran: metro, transportes variados, supermercados, hortifruti, comercio de todo tipo, playa en el mejor tramo del barrio entre los puestos 3 y 4, diversiones, surffing, bodyboarding, kite surf, juegos, en fin, todo muy cerca, en una calle tranquila y segura. El apartamento como constatan y todos pueden confirmar en los comentarios de los huéspedes, además de cómodo, espacioso, bien ventillado, contiene todos los electrodomésticos, internet, televisión por cable, wi fi, cocina completa y todas las habitaciones tienen aire acondicionado. Además, está disponible totalmente para el uso y la privacidad completa de mis huéspedes. Sepan que no tengo ninguna restricción y preferencias por color, raza o género y recibo con placer a todos aquellos que vengan en paz y deseosos de sentirse verdaderos cariocas en esta famosa ciudad llamada Maravillosa.

Under Archsense Apartments and ArchSense Barcelona brands, we are a young and dynamic company that is dedicated to personalized management of tourist apartments and houses in two diferent areas in Spain. In Barcelona  (Catalunya) and Pontevedra (Galicia).

Our management comprises different phases, from the initial search of clients, reception and accommodation in the apartment until his departure. We also take care of the apartment all clean and conditioning time, and to resolve any issues that may arise during a guest's stay.
The main goal of our management is twofold:

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a ""friend"" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city. 
All this expertise  has allowed us to grow gradually, as the viral marketing has proven to be our best advertising tool, and thus many customers and many others have repeated recommend us to their family and friends. As an architect, different owners have also recommended us to their friends to transform their properties for holiday apartments.",1,1013855,1,0,14,"Barcelona, Cataluña, Spain",Alex,Vila de Gràcia,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5f1ceb84-aa15-4eb2-af60-5faa046e9a88.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,100.0,within an hour,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5f1ceb84-aa15-4eb2-af60-5faa046e9a88.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,14,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1013855,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id', 'work_email']"

FAQ: When do I pay for my long-term reservation?
www.airbnb.com/help/question/245

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.


Contact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made.

A little about me...I've recently rediscovered my love for pinball. I love dining-out and love a coursed meal for special occasions.  My favorite city is Chicago, but Brooklyn has won me over too.  I'm a new Crossfit fan - can't wait to finally be able to do a pull-up  :)  I've been a teacher, a bartender, a counselor, and now I work in TV when I'm not hosting.  I love meeting new people over a well-made campari cocktail.

3800450,"Hello Airbnb Community, 

My name is Carolina and I am... a little bit.... gypsy. I love to travel, to learn new cultures, study languages and people, get to know new people and new ways of living. I am currently living in Hawaii, studying to be a midwife, working as a doula (Angels who help sister deliver babies) and managing a few projects in Rio. So although I visit Rio for 3 months a year, Im based in Hawaii and also get to travel around the globe. 

 I can say I am a people's person and love to make people feel good, from hosting to cooking, to massage, thru teaching yoga... etc. I just love to share the things that make me passionate about life in this world. 

That's why I love to talk about Brazil, travel around Brazil and to share the features of this amazing country I am proud to be from. Brazil is my home and Rio is my heart. I am born and raised in Rio, and have experienced this city in a lot of different ways. Here I have been a Law student with long downtown areas and party scenes at night, I've been a nature seeker with long trail/nature hours and good sleep at night, I've been an artist with long days dancing and knowing the theatre/circus scene, I explored Rio as total tourist living in a hostel, and now I have been exploring it while working with education as a citizen and cultural productor. I grow up and its seems that Rio grows up with me. Its always different and better, everytime I come home.

When I travel, I like to feel like I am from there. I like to feel like I am doing what the locals do, feel that I am interacting with the place and its people in its fullest, and so I am a very open traveler. When I host, I like to understand peoples needs, a person who comes to Rio for a bussiness journey, will have different expectations of a person who is traveling for tourism. Or a person who is traveling with family, thinks different than someone who wants to enjoy the party scene in Rio, etc. So, I do love to hear from you, and I will do my best to accommodate your needs. 

Since I don't live full time in Brazil, and because together we can reach places we could never reach alone, I have lovely a co-host who helps me with this. Together we want to create unique ways for our guests to feel welcome.

That's why, we want to hear from you, your opinion is very important to us on this new journey. Our ideal is that the world can be only one, we are one and can live likewise, with love. A big community of people that altogether we can do beautiful things for ourselves, our community, our planet. We want to show love to people, and part of it, we will do by hosting you on the best way we can. 

What is your ideal? How can you feel home? What are things that could improve your experience in a new country? How do you like to meet people? What are your intentions with your trip? If you could choose something, anything, that would make your trip the most memorable, what would you envision? 

Love,

Carolina

Olá Comunidade Airbnb,

Meu nome é Carolina, e eu sou... um poquinho... ""cigana"". Eu amo viajar, conhecer culturas diferentes, estudar linguas e pessoas, entender e conhecer pessoas e novas formas de viver.

No momento, me encontro no Havai, estudando para ser Parteira, trabalhando como Doula (Anjinhas que ajudam mulheres a dar a luz.) e gerenciando alguns projetos no Rio. Eu moro no Rio metade do ano, uma outra parte no Havai e alguns meses consigo viajar, quando meus desejos sao realizados. 

Eu posso dizer que sou uma ""pessoa de pessoas"", porque gosto de fazer pessoas se sentirem bem. De hospedar, a cozinhar, massagens, professora de yoga, etc. Eu simplesmente amo dividir com pessoas todas as coisas lindas que me fazem ser apaixonada pela vida nesse mundo. 

Por isso eu amo falar sobre o Brasil, viajar pelo Brasil e poder dividir essas experiencias por esse pais maravilhoso, o qual tenho orgulho de ter nascido em. O Brasil é minha casa, e o Rio meu coração. Aqui ja vivi diversas fases e conheço cenas diferentes. Desde de uma estudante de Direito com longas horas pelo centro, e conhecendo as festas de noite, á uma naturalista com longas horas no mato e em trilhas e dormindo muito a noite, á artista com longas horas de dança, teatro e circo, já fui turista por completo morando em um hostel, e agora tenho explorado o Rio com projetos pessoais, trabalhando em educaçao e as vezes produtora cultural. Eu vou crescendo e parece que o Rio cresce comigo, é sempre diferente e melhor quando volto pra casa. 

Quando viajo, gosto de sentir que ""sou de lá"". Gosto de viver a cultura e interagir com os lugares e pessoas ao maximo. Por isso, sou uma viajante muito aberta a experiencias. Quando hospedo, gosto de entender as necessidades pessoais de cada um, uma pessoa que procura meu apartamento para uma viagem de negocios, tem expectativas diferentes de alguem que veio á turismo. Pessoas viajando com familia, tem planos diferentes daqueles que vieram a procura da festa perfeita ou etc. Logo, eu gosto de escutar voces, e entender as suas necessidades, vou fazer o meu melhor para acomoda-las. 

Como não moro constantemente no Brasil, e como juntos chegaremos aonde jamais conseguiriamos chegar sozinhos, conto com a ajuda da minha Co-Anfitria. Juntas  nos queremos que os nossos hospedes se sintam em casa, o maximo possivel, queremos inovar e trazer experiencias lindas e diferentes pros nossos hospedes.

Por isso, queremos escutar voces. A sua opiniao é muito importante pra a gente nessa nova jornada.  Nosso ideal é que o mundo é só um. Somos todos um, e podemos viver assim, com amor. Uma enorme comunidade de pessoas que juntos, podemos construir coisas linda pra nós, nossa comunidade e nosso planeta. Queremos distribuir amor para as pessoas, e parte disso fazemos quando hospedamos nossos hospedes da melhor maneira que podemos. 

Qual é o seu ideal? Como você se sente em casa? Que coisas poderiam melhorar a sua estadia em um pais diferente, ou em uma cidade? Como você gosta de conhecer pessoas novas? Quais são suas intenções nessa viagem? Se você pudesse idelizar alguma coisa, qualquer coisa, que faria sua viagem inesquecivel, qual seria sua visão?

That means we love our city and are very proud of it, perhaps especially its football team – the best in Portugal! It’s also evidence of how friendly and hospitable we are, and I’ll do my best to make your visit to Porto really enjoyable. Advice on where to go, the hidden gems that most tourists never get to see, the best places to eat, the best bargains and ways of getting around on a budget – just ask.

I used to live in this apartment, but when my daughter was born, 10 years ago, I moved around the corner. That means I’m readily available to help all I can – it’s what I do for a living, so you’re sure to get my undivided attention.

ただ一つ､予約後はair bnbのｱﾌﾟﾘの更新をした上で操作の確認をすることを忘れないで下さい｡予約ﾍﾟｰｼﾞの閲覧の仕方が頻繁にｱｯﾌﾟｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞしています｡

空港から私のｱﾊﾟｰﾄまでの位置確認､下記参考にして下さい｡

•ｻﾞﾊﾞｽ(市ﾊﾞｽ)
$2ﾄﾞﾙ75ｾﾝﾄ､(十九､二十番)で乗り換え無し､約1時間でｱﾊﾟｰﾄに到着です｡
ﾊﾞｽ内にお釣りはないのでご自身で用意するのをお忘れなく｡
大きなｽｰﾂｹｰｽをお持ちの方は乗車出来ませんが､機内持ち込みｻｲｽﾞで来られる方はﾊﾞｽで来れたら格安です!ﾊﾞｽは寒いので上着必須｡

(7:00-8:30に乗車の場合)
ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ前発 空港行き 
(15:30-18:00に乗車の場合)
途中通勤ﾗｯｼｭに巻き込まれるので確実に1時間以上はかかります｡私もこの時間は運転しないように気をつけています｡

 ""Kuhio Ave and launiu street"" 
ｸﾋｵｱﾍﾞﾆｭｰ ｱﾝﾄﾞ ﾗｳﾆｳｽﾄﾘｰﾄ (ﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝ目の前)
運転手にﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝに行きたいと伝えたらｽﾑｰｽﾞです｡目の前のﾊﾞｽ停で降りて下さい｡

ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発空港行き
""Kuhio Ave and Launiu street""
同じくﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝの道を挟んだ向かいにﾊﾞｽ停が設置されています｡だいたいﾊﾞｽ停は登り､下り､道を挟んで対に設置してあります｡

ﾊﾞｽ停から歩いて30秒でｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発見､到着!ﾊﾞｽに乗り慣れていない方も一度試してみてはいかがでしょう~｡

ﾊﾞｽを降りてﾋﾟﾝｸの3､4階建の建物(個人的には一番の目印にしております)が見えたら､その角がﾗｳﾆｳ ｽﾄﾘｰﾄです｡必ず分かります｡
ﾊﾞｽ道を背に一軒先に行った左手にあるのがこの建物 414 launiu streetです｡

•ﾀｸｼｰ
荷物の積み下ろしやﾁｯﾌﾟだのでだいたい30分かかります｡ﾁｯﾌﾟ入れて$35-$40が目安でしょう｡

•ｼｬﾄﾙﾊﾞｽ
$17くらい｡
ﾜｲｷｷ行きはﾎﾃﾙで降りなければいけないことがおおいのでその際に､ﾎﾘﾃﾞｰｲﾝﾜｲｷｷｴｸｽﾌﾟﾚｽがｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞ的にも降りても差し支えなさそうなﾎﾃﾙ(個人的意見)｡3分くらいでｱﾊﾟｰﾄに着きます｡もしくはｺﾝﾄﾞﾃﾙのﾌｫｰﾊﾟﾄﾞﾙはｱﾊﾟｰﾄの真向かいなので､停まってくれるならとても便利)

•ｳｰﾊﾞｰ､ﾘﾌﾄ

4621926,"Hello! 

I´m a very active AirBnB user, both as a hostess and a guest, so that allows me to (try to) be a good guest and a good hostess.  

My job has the advantage that some days I work from home, and some days I travel for work. Even though I enjoy my home greatly, I really like the idea of spending time in other places, particularly if they are warmer! 

I have two dogs I love very much. Sadly for you, they are not included with the apartment... :) I take them with me everywhere I can so you may get to meet them if you host us. They behave even better than me, but they´re hairier. But then again, I clean after them constantly, so we´re the perfect team. You must know, I´m particularly clean. OK, fine, I´m a clean freak. But I suppose it´s a good quality for a hostess, let alone for a guest! 

I spend most of my time outdoors, whether it´s exploring new and old territories, or in my backyard, which I enjoy immensely. I try to make my home a comfortable, warm and cheery place, where I can concentrate on my work during the day and a good book in the evenings. And when I feel like people-watching, giving my stove a break or enjoying the hustle and bustle of the city, I just have to turn around the corner and voilà! Everything is within walking distance. 

I consider myself a lively person, but I need my peace and quiet at home. And I´m a light sleeper so I am looking to host guests who look for a quiet spot to recover after exploring the city. And as a guest, I look for quiet spots as well, as I usually travel for work and I need to sleep well before and after a long day. 

Airbnb is made up of very different individuals and places, therefore communication, consideration and courtesy are key, and I hope you will find that in me.

I am also vibrant outgoing person with a great sence of humor. I thorougly enjoy travelling and meeting people who are open minded, and respectful. I also enjoy learning and experienceing other culture, such as the food...hmmmmmlol! history, sightseeing, dancing, cooking, shopping and going to the movies and attending cultural events.. I have travelled  extensively throughout Europe and the Caribbean and the USA and thoroughly enjoy doing so. I also enjoy sharing my Caribbean culture as well.
My Homestay offers guest a bit of independence as the rooms are all located on the top floor and has a separate entrance leading to the 2 top floor, and Myself as the host resides exclusively on the main floor and are available to offer assistance should the need occur.

As for things that I can't live without hmm, I have to admit I have not given this much though. All I can say is that I can adapt easily to changes. How did our ancestors survived? We are here aren't we?:)

My life motto is: Cry a little! Laugh a lot! Live life the best way you can always!!  Come and visit with us! You too will enjoy your stay!

I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

I have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago. After I returned from Mexico to Hong Kong in 2014 to start this hotel business, I found that airbnb is one of the best platforms which combines couhcsrufnig and business into one.

I love to travel and to meet new people.  Hosting through Airbnb has allowed me to to do both.  

On my free time I like spend time with family and friends, travel and read - biographies and art are my favorite topics,   I also love history, interior decoration and photography.  Lately I have had a growing interest in reading about natural food and natural healing through meditation and yoga.  So I have been spending a lot of time cooking and attending to my herb garden.

I have lived most of my life in Rio. so I know the city well.   Since the 80´s, when I came back from a small liberal arts college in the US where I majored in History and Political Science, I started hosting friends vacationing  in Rio.  I have started hosting visitors from college  every year.   Some were coming for the first time, others came every other year.   This experience has enabled me to see the city through the eyes of new comers.

Entre mis libros favoritos están La Isla del Tesoro o El País de las Sombras Largas. Me encanta el REGGAE.
Sonia: No puedo vivir sin el mar, sin música, sin sueños y sin mariscos!!! Soy una ávida lectora y me encanta probar nuevas cosas, comida y experiencias por lo menos alguna vez en mi vida.

Nuestra Casita del Mar es una mezcla de colores que en cuanto entrés por la puerta te llenarás de pura positivad!

I am an avid reader and a complete science fiction freak, I actually subscribe to sci fi/fantasy magazine. Reading is my zen to chill and relax. I love exotic and different food while drinking yummy wine.  It helps loving the outdoors because I can burn off what I eat. I enjoy, hiking, camping, surfing, snorkeling, diving. Anything that is on or surrounded by ocean or forest makes me happiest.  I make friends easily and love spending time with cool and interesting people.

     I do need to say that you are lookıng into Galata which is one of the best oldest neighborhoods of Istanbul, and important cultural center for local people and foreigners that located at the North of the Golden Horn, towards Taksim Squere that includes Pera and Beyoglu. I want to let you know about myself, my job and my home studio. Firstly,  I was born in Bursa, Turkey in 1979. I have been living in Istanbul for 15 years. I have got my Bachelor Degree in Istanbul, Bilgi University, department of  Photography and Video (P.O.V.). As you see I am really interested in art and I love creating. I do my job freelance, because I belive that I need to feel free to create more and express better. I have had my own studio before I have decided to have my own home-studio. Now, I do not only love working and living here becouse of the location, but also because of the atmosphere of my place. I mean there are beautiful old houses , buildings, cafes, museums, galleries, historical places, all kinds of restaurants and all kinds of transportations options. Further more, it really helps me to  let go of anxiety, stress and feel more confortable, that is peacefull and relaxing. For instance I am able to listen loudly music whenever I would like, or I do not hear any other’s in here.  Lastly, at these days, I am planning to be a part of one art collective or collaborate with some young artists . If you like, you  can bring you ideas, creativity and art into my collaboration.

I'm a happy, energetic, organised and social person who enjoys life. Living in Sydney is a treat. Before or after work you can have a surf and during the evenings or at weekends you can enjoy the nightlife at the hip bars or nightclubs Sydney has to offer.

You will love your stay here in Bondi and enjoy the peace and tranquility of the ocean at your door step whilst only being a few minutes from all the action.
Airbnb makes travel so much more personal and allows everyone to get the ‘local experience’ so I’m really pleased at the prospect of playing a part in someone’s dream holiday!

5923031,"Hi  
I am both a Super Host and traveller, so my places are designed for absolute comfort with discerning travellers like myself in mind!

As a long standing Australian Super host, I strive to offer fabulous, unique, sparkling clean accommodation in the vibrant Sydney suburb of Newtown just 3km from the CBD, walk to Sydney Uni and RPA Hospital.  I have been offering accommodation for 17 years, before Air BnB I was listed on more commercial sites.

My point of difference is I have a ABN and my business is run to a professional standard with correct insurances etc. There are no common shared spaces. You are not squeezing into someone else home! My places are your home away from home.

Having returned from travelling, 3 times to Santa Barbara in 2018, and in 2017  (kayaking in Antarctica and exploring Chile) and having worked in Geneva and NYC, I strive to offer guests what I need myself, a very comfortable bed, quality linen, quiet but interesting environment and a place to eat and work (a real table and chairs!), a couch, outdoor space and Wifi!

Much of my time is spent travelling  and hosting and I also have my own Clinical and teaching mental health practice so I am busy!

Here's my hosting story:

In 2000 I purpose built Studio Q as a stand alone Studio in my garden in O'Connor, a sought after leafy inner suburb with cafes a easy 10 min walk away.  The City is 3km away and ANU a 15 min walk.  This property has been sold but Simon is now hosting Studio Q.

In Newton (Sydney) I have 3 fantastic apartments in the same complex with a roof top garden.  3 mins to the train and on ""the strip"" of restaurants, cafes, bookshops, movie and live theatres.  Please read more under Newtown Mews listings.

You will find my favourite local tips in each unit (i.e. best local cafes, great walks and the best the area has to offer).  I am a non intrusive host, and available by phone or email between 9-7pm,  I do not offer a 24 hr Concerige service but reviews conclude I am helpful and available in reasonable hours.",1,7044418,1,1,3,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Narelle,Newtown/Enmore,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7044418/profile_pic/1371880419/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,100.0,within an hour,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7044418/profile_pic/1371880419/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,3,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/7044418,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id']"

We enjoy meeting interesting, creative and passionate people from around the world and sharing our love of Brooklyn and New York City with them -- the history, food, art, architecture, and music. What we offer is a room in a beautiful house. We are relaxed and welcoming. We ask that our guests make themselves at home (and we do all we can to make them as comfortable as possible). Staying with us is like staying with friends or family (who can cook well). We do not have locks on room doors (although we do fully respect our guest's privacy). This is not a hotel or a bed and breakfast ""business"" (no teddy bears or pot pourri). It is sometimes elegant and sometimes casual. We like vintage furniture, street art, local food, and all kinds of music ...  an urban sensibility. It's 'real life' in this house -- we have dogs who are enthusiastic greeters, teenagers who are in and out and friends who stop by. That said, we try really hard to make each guest's stay wonderfully memorable. Please read our reviews. We have had amazing guests!

5986898,"My husband Rob is an architect/developer and I am recently retired from working in IT at a large northern California utility company. We knew each other in our early teens and remained friends into our 20s. In 2004 we ran into each other completely serendipitously and a few years later were married in our garden in Berkeley, surrounded by friends and family. We are both interested in art, architecture and music, where his tastes are classically inclined and mine tend more towards the Grateful Dead and lately, everything ukulele.  We love hiking, reading, traveling and good conversation.

My first trip to Kauai was in 1975 and it was love at first sight. Smitten, and haunted by memories of green and blue and rainbows and Bali Hai, I moved there in 1977, just in time for my twin daughters to be born at Wilcox Hospital in Lihue.  We ended up moving back to the mainland a year later, but in the intervening years, we vacationed there many times as a family. One of the twins eventually heeded the island's call and in 2012 moved to Princeville with her husband and family. (You could probably count on one hand the number of days they have not been at the beach or on a wave since moving!) I hope to persuade my city-loving husband to consider retiring to Kauai. So far he has promised me a month per year.  That's a start.

I HATE WASTING so please take a good care of everything I borrow you and do not throw away things we can still use: unused tickets, maps, leaflets, travel guides and recycle as much as possible. Don't waste energy, water, paper, food, etc and keep it clean and neat. If you like consumerism, wasting, do not like recycling and sharing I think this is not the right place for you.
Finally I live in the red light street, so if you don't like to see prostitutes in the street please don't choose my place or if you come do not give me a bad evaluation for the location, location is perfect and they were here before me and you.

I studied in England, lived there for seven years( considering its a long time)  I sometimes confuse my nationalty :)  I love music both listening and making. I play violin and guitar and besides Im a dance teacher too. I am a nature person who runs away to the mountains and lakes and camp there in her tiny spare time. I work busy hours because ı only work with business people.

My place is very central which is in a walking distance to all puplic transports and easy to get to and find. We have three bedroom in my big flat and ı sometimes I invite my students in the living room for lessons but very rarely. If you see people laughing around dont be surprised :) The building is not pretty new as nearly all flats are the same in Kadikoy area.  My neighbourhood is very safe and everybody knows eachother here and all of them are lovely people. I used to have a dog in the last years as you read in the rewievs but my friend  took her from me to a lovely farm where she is free and happy. House will be very clean when you checked in and I dont do a deep cleaning until you leave so try to be nice and tidy :) There are no rules in this house!!! I love people who treats this area as their own place. 

I have been hosting people on Airbnb for three years and had lovely friends and unforgetable experiences. Some of them stayed for a day and some of them stayed for three months bu we still keep in touch with most of them. I love meeting new people, listening different stories, learn abour their culture. Maybe Ill ask you to go out together if we have or play a game or even a long chat if you want ofcourse.

  My family lives in Alaska. I am a stay at home mom. I grow a big ,organic garden for my family. We choose Hawaii as a place to visit yearly, and enjoy our trip to keep our place looking wonderful.

Welcome to Secret Falls Retreat in Kapaa, on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.

We are a permitted Homestay with the County of Kauai!:).

Use Permit No. U-2015-14
Class IV Zoning Permit Z-IV-2015-15

This property formerly called Mohala Ke Ola, has been running as a BnB for over 25 years. You will find it listed in the old Kauai guide books, we renamed it in 2011 when I purchased the property. You can really hear the water falls roar on a quiet night after the rainfall, and you can hike to the falls from the back deck. Hence, what a better name than Secret Falls Retreat!. 
We were closed for a while as we did many renovations and upgrades, but are up and running 100% now and look forward to hosting you and receiving new reviews soon!:).
 
I am origainlly from California, grew up in Northern British Columbia, Canada. 
I love the outdoors and am a workaholic, always busy! Tim was born and raised in Hawaii, so you have all the local inside information you need:). We have 3 children ages 8, 12 and 15 that attend a private and public school here on Kauai.  They help out with the BnB when time allows between their studies and extracurricular activities.  We enjoy the beach, hiking, horseback riding, paddle boarding, beach Volley Ball, fishing, and soccer. 
As we love music, we also own an event company called Hawaiian Muzik Factory, so we do weddings, anniverseries, baby parties, graduation parties ect. We also have large event tents, tables, sound systems, lights, and live bands.  Between the kids, the BnB and the Muzik Factory, it is a busy fun life in paradise! We look forward to meeting you!

Our property has a solar heated salt water pool and jacuzzi. Located right in the middle of the island, so you can go to north shore or south shore in 45 min to an hour either way.  No need to bounce accomadations to see the whole island! We live on the property and are available for assistance most of the time. Some of the best restaurants, beaches and shopping is only minutes away. Hiking trails on the Sleeping Giant are within walking distance. We offer a continental breakfast that varies depending on availability of local produce and fruits ect. We do not have breakfast on Sundays and Holidays as that is our family time:). We are a family run operation and look forward to hosting you:).

Surf, snowboard, hiking and biking trips as much as possible.  I bought and remodeled the house in Hana for quick Maui staycations to surf and play in the rainforest hikes with family and friends, and the design of the home and cottage is to my type of lifestyle, indoor/outdoor living, comfortable furnishings, and ample room to prepare meals and relax.

Some of my favorite travel destinations are Canada and Colorado for the boarding, camping, hiking and biking, houseboat trips to Lake Powell, and, if time/money allow, the southwest of France for the surf, food, wine and culture.

My travel style has modified over the years.  It used to be budget all the way.  Those years are behind me, now I prefer a reasonable price, a clean place, with amenities, and convenience to the happening spots in the area, which is exactly what I want to provide for others in Hana as an Airbnb host.

My brother lives nearby which is so nice for me, and also handy if you need anything while staying here if I'm traveling. I usually work just 5 blocks away so feel free to bug me if need something while I'm at work. I can pop back to the apt to help. As a designer, the schedule is really flexible.

空港から私のｱﾊﾟｰﾄまでの位置確認､下記参考にして下さい｡

•ｻﾞﾊﾞｽ(市ﾊﾞｽ)
$2ﾄﾞﾙ75ｾﾝﾄ､(十九､二十番)で乗り換え無し､約1時間でｱﾊﾟｰﾄに到着です｡
ﾊﾞｽ内にお釣りはないのでご自身で用意するのをお忘れなく｡

 ""Kuhio Ave and launiu street""

ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発空港行き
""Kuhio Ave and Launiu street""
同じくﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝの道を挟んだ向かいにﾊﾞｽ停が設置されています｡だいたいﾊﾞｽ停は登り､下り､道を挟んで対に設置してあります｡

ﾊﾞｽ停から歩いて30秒でｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発見､到着!ﾊﾞｽに乗り慣れていない方も一度試してみてはいかがでしょう~｡

ﾊﾞｽを降りてﾋﾟﾝｸの3､4階建の建物(個人的には一番の目印にしております)が見えたら､その角がﾗｳﾆｳ ｽﾄﾘｰﾄです｡必ず分かります｡
ﾊﾞｽ道を背に一軒先に行った左手にあるのがこの建物 414 launiu streetです｡

•ﾀｸｼｰ
荷物の積み下ろしやﾁｯﾌﾟだのでだいたい30分かかります｡ﾁｯﾌﾟ入れて$35-$40が目安でしょう｡

•ｼｬﾄﾙﾊﾞｽ
$17くらい｡
ﾜｲｷｷ行きはﾎﾃﾙで降りなければいけないことがおおいのでその際に､ﾎﾘﾃﾞｰｲﾝﾜｲｷｷｴｸｽﾌﾟﾚｽがｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞ的にも降りても差し支えなさそうなﾎﾃﾙ(個人的意見)｡3分くらいでｱﾊﾟｰﾄに着きます｡もしくはｺﾝﾄﾞﾃﾙのﾌｫｰﾊﾟﾄﾞﾙはｱﾊﾟｰﾄの真向かいなので､停まってくれるならとても便利)

9444630,"Greetings! Despite how unnatural it feels to try and ""describe"" a human being, especially one's own self, let's give it a shot. I'm an independent game developer, which is a fancy term for ""a human who's chosen not to earn as much money as he could be earning in order not to be told how to do things"". Having lived in almost every part of Istanbul (and therefore having seen its lowest as well as its highest) I found myself unable to move away from the Galata area and eventually settled here.

As a host, I'm doing Airbnb for the sake of meeting with new people and having an excuse for drinking more beer. Being into this sort of a thing solely for the purpose of having an extra income is, tho I respect that choice as well, just not for me. I'm more of a ""eh, let's be off with the fake pleasantries, fake smiles, fake impersonations and hit the damned pub!"" person, being much more into conversations and interactions where all sides are genuine and not parts of self-made scripts. 

There's something lovely about knowing that I've helped someone enjoy their trip more. It's not always easy getting a taste of the local life in Istanbul since authentic cities such as this are also usually hyper-touristy. What's more is that the understanding of a ""local life"" will differ from one part of the city to another, it's as non homogeneous as it gets and that's why I love helping my guests around - so that they can experience how we ""the Galata area people"" live.
